    <p>Ornaments, on a tree, hang permanently.</p>
    <p>Whether unique, plan, or weird, all will succumb,</p>
    <p>Once hung, a part of the tree it does become.</p>
    <p>Out on the lawn, a tree, a new memory,</p>
    <p>Ornaments still bound to each extremity.</p>
    <p>No one paid any mind to leaving them behind,</p>
    <p>Cheap decorations, held no expectations.</p>
    <p>And next year’s would be better, don’t ya know.</p>
    <p>Except in one house, with a petulant child,</p>
    <p>With an funny attachment, most would find wild.</p>
    <p>The start of each new year would be full of tears.</p>
    <p>Pleads for one more day, before they go away.</p>
    <p>But no was ever said, as the tree stood dead,</p>
    <p>And a small heart would break all over again.</p>
    <p>No one could tell from where this obsession came,</p>
    <p>But most came to know the child, #name#, by fame.</p>
    <p>Over the years #name# grew out of tears.</p>
    <p>Growing and able, and proud of the label.</p>
    <p>A few, #name# would steal, and some pain did heal,</p>
    <p>A collection, in secret, started to grow.</p>
    <p>It soon was found out, and after a long shout,</p>
    <p>Concessions were made, and the weirdness did fade,</p>
    <p>After all, people did collect stranger things.</p>
    <p>First it was funny and cost little money,</p>
    <p>And no greater thanks would a kid ever give.</p>
    <p>When searching for the best gift, it was well known,</p>
    <p>Reputation spread, how the passion had grown.</p>
    <p>The years quickly past, as the collection grew,</p>
    <p>And a new friend, found love, made one out of two.</p>
    <p>Foundations were soon laid, and new lives now made.</p>
    <p>The ornaments would stay safely packed away,</p>
    <p>Save for once a year, and for only a day,</p>
    <p>Out they would stay, on a table for display.</p>
    <p>And told glory of each origin story.</p>
    <p>With a happy small tear and waiting each year.</p>
    <p>But the absence of a tree simply wouldn’t do.</p>
    <p>We’ll cut off the branches and put them away,</p>
    <p>Next year, adhere, the tree with last year’s array.</p>
    <p>Each year it’d get bigger, and yet they’d figure,</p>
    <p>Ropes, stands, and ladders while keeping what matters.</p>
    <p>Every year, with a tear, #name# would observe,</p>
    <p>Each ornament hanging safely preserved.</p>
    <p>Old ones and new ones, with little space for show.</p>
    <p>Branches strung to branches causing them to curve.</p>
    <p>Following each snow, it continued to grow.</p>
    <p>It had now come to be quite a monstrous tree,</p>
    <p>A cringe worthy sample of topiary.</p>
    <p>What they would do the next year they did not know.</p>
    <p>More structure, more rigging, and starting in June,</p>
    <p>They’ll need a shipping container, someday soon.</p>
    <p>Regarding them now, with some ninety years past,</p>
    <p>The relations, and loved ones that did not last.</p>
    <p>All the ornaments, not one of them was lost,</p>
    <p>Needed, soon, to be hung, no matter the cost.</p>
    <p>Some neighbors came to aid the lonely elder,</p>
    <p>With a large effort, they managed the welter.</p>
    <p>Out on the lawn, for the whole world to come see,</p>
    <p>A structure inspiring curiosity.</p>
    <p>A single child remained to ascertain,</p>
    <p>The secret reason for this Christmas treason.</p>
    <p>One after one, #name# would stay, and relay,</p>
    <p>A story of love, not lightly cast away.</p>
    <p>Memories are like ornaments, you see,</p>
    <p>On a heart, they hang, permanently.</p>
